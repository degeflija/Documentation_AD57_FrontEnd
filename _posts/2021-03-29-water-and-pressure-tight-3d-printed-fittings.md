PCB and electronics of the sensor board are almost finalized. First in-flight tests seem feasible soon. One of the last missing parts is a 5mm hose connection to the pressure sensors for static and total pressure. Is 3D FDM printing a good solution to produce such parts?

FreeCAD constructions: One version with printed M5 threads and one for pressure tightness tests with glued in hose adapters.

Water tightness tests with a 1m water column revealed that 3D printing of water and pressure tight parts is not simple!

Several adapters has been printed from PETG with different slicer settins. The adapters are extremely rigid and layer adhesion is outstanding. Small gaps persist even with optimized print settings! A 1m water column test always showed leakages.

Further increasing wall thickness could help. Overall there should be a more suitable solutions, such as milling or SLA printing to produce this kind of technical parts.
